# Retrieving images from Leopard Imaging stereo camera

This is a class in C++ that does the heavylifting of fetching the two (right-and-left) monochrome images from the LI-OV580-STEREO stereo camera, and does so while giving meaningful error messages and recovering "cleanly" after disconnecting which is not uncommon in robotic 
applications.
