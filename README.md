# Retrieving Footage from the LI-OV580-STEREO stereo camera

This is a class in C++ that does the heavylifting of extracting the two (right-and-left) monochrome images from the LI-OV580-STEREO stereo camera, and doing this while giving meaningful error messages and recovering "cleanly" after a disconnection occurs which is common in 
robotic applications.

The camera is made by a company called Leopard Imaging.
