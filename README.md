# Driver code for the LI-OV580-STEREO camera from Leopard Imaging

So I suppose you have decided to purchase the same camera me and my colleagues bought back in 2015 for a robot we were working on.
Soon after receiving the camera, we started scratching our heads wondering how to retrieve stereo footage from it.

Worry no more, here you have a class in C++ that does the heavylifting for you. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate 
to reach out!
